    <p><h3 class="dashbor">The User Interface of a website may be considered one of the more important aspects of designing a website. The User Interface allows the user to interact with the website they are viewing. The User Interface also deals with a large amount of the visual aspects of a website. The UI is about functionality and seeing what works well together. It helps to know coding for UI design but it is not fully necessary. The first UI was called the graphical user interface (GUI). The GUI was not intended for personal use and was used mostly for research in universities. In 1983, Apple introduced the Lisa, the first computer with a GUI. The development of the UI that we know today has taken 50+ years to get to. Progressing the design of the UI has become more prevalent in recent years.</h3></p>

                    <li>The Xerox Star Workstation was the first commercial personal computer. It was officially named the Xerox 8010 Information System. It had a bitmapped display and window-based GUI. It functioned with icons, folders, mouse (two-button), Ethernet networking, file servers, print servers, and e-mail.The main idea of the user interface was to imitate the office paradigm in order to make it intuitive for users. The Xerox Star user interface was based on the concept of objects. For example, a word processing document would hold page objects, paragraph objects, sentence objects, word objects, and character objects. The user could interact with objects by clicking on them with the mouse, and by pressing dedicated keys on the keyboard to cause standard object functions (open, delete, copy, move). There was also a "Show Properties" key used to display settings, called property sheets, for the particular object (e.g., font size for a character object). These general set-ups simplified the structure of all the programs. </li>
