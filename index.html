    <p><h3>The User Interface of a website may be considered one of the more important aspects of designing a website. The User Interface allows the user to interact with the website they are viewing. The User Interface also deals with a large amount of the visual aspects of a website. The UI is about functionality and seeing what works well together. It helps to know coding for UI design but it is not fully necessary. The first UI was called the graphical user interface (GUI). The GUI was not intended for personal use and was used mostly for research in universities. In 1983, Apple introduced the Lisa, the first computer with a GUI. The development of the UI that we know today has taken 50+ years to get to. Progressing the design of the UI has become more prevalent in recent years.</h3></p>
